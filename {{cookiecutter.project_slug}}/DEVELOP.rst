Information for Development
===========================

The structure that was automatically created for your structure will seem daunting at first, but 
this file will walk you through the most imporant parts and aspects of this structure step-by-step.

====================
📁 Project Structure
====================

Here is an overview of the project structure.

- ``DEVELOP.rst`` - You are here. This file provides additional information for the development of 
  your project.
- ``README.rst`` - This will serve as other peoples entry point to your project. The ``rst`` file 
  extension of this file indicates the usage of reStructuredText_, which is a specific markup language 
  to produce text files that can be rendered with richer formatting. Such a README_ file will actually 
  be recognized and rendered when someone opens a project's github page.
- ``pyproject.toml`` - This file contains the configuration about the package in general. In this file 
  you'll have to, for example, list all the third party packages that your own code depends on with their 
  specific version so that the same environment can be recreated on other's systems as well.
